## Why is the Calderón–Zygmund lemma the generalization of the Rising Sun lemma?

Below is a commonly encountered lemma about continuous functions, which you can find in books like Stein's Real Analysis or on related Wikipedia pages. Let's call it Rising Sun Lemma 1:

<strong>Rising Sun Lemma 1: </strong>Let $G:\mathbb R\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and $E=\lbrace x:\exists y>x, g(y)>g(x)\rbrace$. Then $E$ is the union of at most countable disjoint open intervals $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_k$ such that if $(a_k,b_k)$ is a finite interval, then $G(a_k)=G(b_k)$.

<strong>Rising Sun Lemma 1: </strong>Let and . There exists at most countable disjoint intervals such that
