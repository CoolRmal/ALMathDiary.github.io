## A Sufficient Condition for Independence of Random Variables Using the Idea of Approximation

When I was reading a note about <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/245a-notes-5-free-probability/">Free Probability</a>, I learnt the following proposition:

<strong>Proposition 1: Givens two random variables $X,Y$. If for all pairs of bounded continuous functions $f,g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, we have

$$E[f(X)g(Y)]=E[f(X)]E[g(Y)]$$

Then $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

Before going to the details of the proof, let's first
