## Uniqueness of the Euclidean Topology

Let's denote the usual Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathcal{T}$. We know that in this topology, every interval of the form $(a,b)$ for some $-\infty\leq a<b\leq \infty$ is open, and every interval of the form $[c,d]$ for some $-\infty<c\leq d<\infty$ is compact. These are the properties within our expectations, or at least they kind of align with our intuition. The question we are concerned about in this blog is:

<strong>Is $\mathcal{T}$ the unique topology on $\mathbb{R}$ such that every interval of the form $(a,b)$ for some $-\infty\leq a<b\leq \infty$ is open, and every interval of the form $[c,d]$ for some $-\infty<c\leq d<\infty$ is compact?</strong>

Suppose $\mathcal{H}$ is a topology that satisfy these properties. Since $\lbrace(a,b)\rbrace$ form a basis for $\mathcal{T}$ and all of them are open in $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{T}\subset\mathcal{H}$.
