Hello, this is Aaron Lin. I am currently a math concentrator at Brown University, and my main interests are harmonic analysis and HoTT. I share my experiences of learning math here. I often find the proofs in textbooks difficult to understand, so I hope to share some of my own understanding of mathematics here and provide some motivation for various concepts. If you like my content or have any questions related to mathematics, feel free to contact me via email.
