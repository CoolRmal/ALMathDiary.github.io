description: "In my daily study of mathematics, I often find the proofs in textbooks to be obscure and difficult to understand. 
Therefore, I hope to share some of my own understanding of mathematics here and provide some motivation for various concepts. 
If you like my content or have any questions related to mathematics, feel free to contact me via email." # This will show up in places like twitter, linkedin, etc, if you share your sites url as a post.
